    <h1>Depth</h1>
      <p>
      	We move around, dig shallow, and find nothing valualbe. <br></br>
      	From no matter where, when digging deeply enough, <br></br>
        you'll find something valuable. <br></br><br></br>
      	Valuable things are huge enough to be found from many directions. <br></br>
      	It is the core. It locates at the very deep spot. <br></br><br></br>
      	Keep digging. <br></br><br></br>
      	No matter what happens, keep digging. <br></br>
      	Don't give excuses to stop. <br></br><br></br>
      	No matter what people say, keep digging. <br></br>
      	Don't make any moment to argue. <br></br><br></br>
      	Keep digging.

    <h1>Choice</h1>
      <p>
        The more choices we have, the happier we feel. <br></br>
        How can we have more choices? <br></br><br></br>
        Stop giving up choices. <br></br><br></br>
        I mean, we tend to narrow our chioces by the internal voice, <br></br>
        "No, you cannot do that." <br></br><br></br>
        We don't realize that becasue it's inside us.<br></br><br></br>
        You gain more choices if you liberate your heart from the noise. <br></br><br></br>
        Stop giving up choices. <br></br><br></br>
        Start making more choices.

    <h1>Meditation</h1>
      <p>
        Listen to the silence. <br></br>
        Be aware of the sound of nothingness. <br></br><br></br>
        Look at the air. <br></br>
        Be aware of the color of emptiness. <br></br><br></br>
        Stand here. <br></br>
        Be aware of the force of gravity. <br></br><br></br>
        Take a few minute. <br></br>
        Be aware of the value of the present. <br></br><br></br>
        Take one more minute. <br></br><br></br><br>
        Now, you go.
